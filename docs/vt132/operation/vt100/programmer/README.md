# VT100 (enhanced) Programmer Information (Draft)

## Background

The VT132 faithfully implements almost all of the features of the original Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) VT100, with the Advanced Video Option installed.

To this a range of enhancements have been added

- many are features of later DEC VT family terminals that have been implemented for convenience
- some are features of "standard" ANSI terminals (mainly IBM PC/MS DOS based terminal emulators)
- enhancements are highlighted by the addition of *(enhancement)* to the heading or description

A good reference for an owner of a VT100 (especially getting started with the Setup screens) is the original [VT100 Users Guide](https://vt100.net/docs/vt100-ug/contents.html) over at [VT100.net](https://vt100.net/). Details of what the [Advanced Video Option](https://vt100.net/docs/vt100-ug/chapter4.html#S4.1) adds can be found here also.

The remainder of this section will largely focus on where the VT132 implementation of the VT100 differs to an original VT100.
